Forecast bikeshare demand using time series models in R

Project scenario

A bike rental company wants to improve its fleet management and pricing strategy by forecasting future bike rental demands. As the data analyst aligned with this project, you will conduct a time series analysis using daily rental transaction data. Your forecast will help the company determine the optimal number of bikes to keep in each station and set dynamic pricing based on predicted demand. This insight will enhance the company's logistic processes, reduce costs, and maximize profits. Your responsibilities will include loading, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing data, and building time series models to forecast future demands.

Summary

This project forecasts daily bike rental demand using time series models on data from the Capital Bikeshare system (2011-2012).

Solution

The solution involves a comprehensive time series analysis and modeling process, leveraging R and its rich ecosystem of packages for time series forecasting. The project includes data loading and exploration, interactive visualization, time series smoothing, decomposition, stationarity assessment, and fitting ARIMA models for forecasting. A manual ARIMA model is used to provide accurate forecasts efficiently.  


Approach

Data Exploration: Loaded and analysed the bike_sharing_daily dataset.

Visualisation: Created interactive plots to identify trends.

Smoothing: Cleaned and smoothed the data.

Decomposition: Decomposed the series and checked for stationarity.

ARIMA Modelling: Used ACF/PACF plots for manual ARIMA fitting and generated forecasts.
